# MakeID SDK Usage Guide

This project demonstrates how to use **MakeID SDK** to create label layouts by drawing elements such as:

- Text  
- Barcode (1D code)  
- QR Code  
- Lines  
- Rectangles (frames)  
- Images  

and how to call APIs to connect to MakeID label printers via **Bluetooth** for printing.
